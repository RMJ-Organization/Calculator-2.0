# Calculator 2.0
The source code for RMJ's Calculator 2.0 application. All Code is in Python

This Application is a Powerful Python based Calculator built on very simple framework. Please do look inside. 

Download Latest Application Version Here: <a href="https://rjx.har.mybluehost.me/file/calculator.exe">RJX File Mirror</a>

If you have the Python, the Python Compiled Version and the Python RAW version is available on this GitHub Page. It is a much faster and more usable version of the Application as the compiler ( Pyinstaller ) compiled the included Library on the App making it much slower. 

Thanks for Using Calculator 2.0.
